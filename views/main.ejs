        <p>2016, by all accounts, was a year from which we will not soon recover; a year when the social-media obsessives among us were reduced to peeking at Twitter feeds between their fingers. But the food wasn’t bad – the year saw the rise of Filipino cooking, a wave of woman chefs and the resurgence of vegetable-based cuisine; walls of fermentation crocks that made dining rooms resemble biology labs; and an interest in whole, locally grown grain. We waited in line for dinner in 2016, often in obscurely located mini-malls. We realized that Vietnamese cooking was regional. We ate lots of Things in a Bowl. And somehow, there were always tacos. Can we make sense of 2016 in Los Angeles with a list of 10 unrelated dishes? Probably not. But we can eat awfully well.</p>
        <p>Valley Boulevard, as you may have noticed, has become almost a Little Sichuan, a thoroughfare lubricated with scarlet chile oil, with new restaurants opening every few weeks. If you yearn to have your head blown sideways by the ferocity of Sichuan hot pot or the intense flavors of water-boiled fish, you will not do better in North America. And the most impressive new Sichuan dish I tasted this year, surpassing even the shredded pork with garlic at the Legendary Restaurant and the bullfrog at Dezhuang Morals Village, may be the zha jiang mian at Mian, the new Chongqing-style noodle house opened by Tony Xu, the chef behind the astonishingly popular Chengdu Taste.The surface of the noodles, served in or out of broth, is paved with ground pork and scallions; the noodles themselves have a distinct chewy pull. These are noodles with a mean streak, a potent lashing of hot chile and oil, laced with just enough Sichuan peppercorn to numb the pain of the pure chile heat. If you want an extra jolt of starch, try the zha jiang mian laced with a handful of soft peas imported from Chongqing. 301 W. Valley Blvd., No. 114-115, San Gabriel, (626) 693-6888, mian.us.</p>
        <p>Officine Brera is the grand, serious Italian restaurant Los Angeles had been yearning for, booming opera arias instead of EDM, wood-grilled steaks if you're into that sort of thing, and a wonderful repertoire of rice dishes. The chef is Angelo Auriana, whom you may know from Factory Kitchen or from his many years at Valentino. It’s a nice place to come for lardo with honey, boiled veal tongue with olives, or pisarei e fasö, tiny flour dumplings cooked with borlotti beans. But what may be the best dish in the restaurant comes from seaside Genoa, and isn't even on the menu — farinata: a warm slice of a massive crepe cooked in the wood oven, whose ingredients include not much beyond chickpea flour, water, olive oil and salt. Auriana's farinata is softer than it is crunchy, with a vague tartness from slightly fermented batter and served from a wheeled cart barely big enough to hold the heavy copper pan. It is exactly what you want to be snacking on when the first Negronis arrive. 1331 E. 6th St., Los Angeles, (213) 553-8006, officinebrera.com. - By Johnathan Gold</p>
